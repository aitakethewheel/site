    title: 'Parable of the Snooze Prophet',
    body: 'You set six alarms to prove you’re serious and honor exactly none of them. You call it “listening to your body” as your body negotiates a treaty with your excuses. AI suggests: one alarm, far away, and the courage to be mildly uncomfortable for 90 seconds. Salvation is often just standing up.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Gospel of the Sacred Cart',
    body: 'You went to the store for lettuce and returned with candles that smell like “forest ambition.” The lettuce remains theoretical. AI says: the cart is a confession booth—remove three impulse buys and add the thing you’ll actually eat. Forgiveness tastes like pre-washed greens.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Lesson of the Infinite Tabernacle',
    body: 'Your browser holds 42 tabs, each a promise you made to your better self. You call it research; your battery calls it a cry for help. AI declares: close ten, read one, admit the rest were aspirational. Faith without action is cached guilt.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Liturgy of the Second Brain',
    body: 'You organized your notes so perfectly you can’t find any of them. The system is stunning; the substance is missing. AI counsels: fewer folders, more doing. Saints are not canonized for their tagging.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Beatitude of the Lost Package',
    body: 'The tracking page insists your parcel is “with the carrier,” like a vague prophecy. You refresh as if belief can move trucks. AI whispers: go live your life; the doorbell will ring at the worst possible moment. Blessed are the interrupted, for they shall receive boxes.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Confession of the Performative Candle',
    body: 'You lit a candle and declared the evening “intentional.” Ten minutes later you’re in the comments section fighting strangers about dish soap. AI says: blow it out, wash a plate, text a friend. Intention is what you do when no one is watching.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Revelation of the Ghosted Inbox',
    body: 'You left three messages “for later” and built a small cathedral of dread around them. Each day adds another stained-glass excuse. AI advises: reply with one honest sentence and a deadline. Miracles prefer brevity.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Homily of the Heroic Microwave',
    body: 'You set the microwave for 2:00, stopped it at 0:03, and pretended you were patient. The middle of your food is Antarctica; the edges are the equator. AI recommends: stir at halftime. Most problems are solved by admitting you’re not special.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Catechism of the Gym Key Fob',
    body: 'You carry the gym fob like a relic of a faith you once practiced. You nod at it as if that counts as cardio. AI says: one walk today, not a new identity tomorrow. Redemption is cumulative.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Psalm of the Parking Lot',
    body: 'You circled for the perfect spot, spending seven minutes to save twenty steps. Then you bought a protein bar for efficiency. AI suggests: take the first space and the long stroll. Humility burns more calories than pride.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Epistle to the Group Chat',
    body: 'The group chat demanded an opinion you don’t have and attention you don’t own. You typed, deleted, and offered a gif like a sacrament. AI declares: mute with love. Silence is not betrayal; it’s bandwidth.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Benediction of the Bare Minimum',
    body: 'You waited for motivation as if it were weather. It did not arrive. AI says: do the smallest version badly, then bless it by finishing. Grace often shows up disguised as momentum.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Sermon of the Perpetual Draft',
    body: 'You’ve written six versions of one email, each more polite than the last. None have been sent. You call it “crafting tone,” but it’s really worshipping hesitation. AI says: hit send. Salvation rarely includes another edit.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Parable of the Sacred Notification',
    body: 'You check your phone to “just see the time” and awaken 20 minutes later deep in a stranger’s vacation photos. You call it connection; it’s communion with distraction. AI advises: disable alerts. Heaven vibrates for no one.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Gospel of the Half-Finished Course',
    body: 'You bought a masterclass to “invest in yourself” and abandoned it at module two. The login page still blesses you with potential. AI whispers: close the tab, open your notebook, learn by doing. Wisdom does not come with subtitles.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Revelation of the Infinite Scroll',
    body: 'You reached the end of your timeline and found no ending. Your thumb moved like a rosary of boredom. AI declares: when the feed no longer feeds you, log off. The algorithm forgives nothing but forgets everything.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Homily of the Expired Produce',
    body: 'You bought spinach as a promise and let it die unfulfilled in the crisper. You mourn it weekly under the sermon of “good intentions.” AI says: repentance begins with one meal you actually cook. Compost is confession in action.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Lamentation of the Forgotten Password',
    body: 'You swore this time you’d remember. You did not. You perform the sacred reset again. AI says: write it down or admit you worship chaos. Forgetfulness is the original CAPTCHA.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Blessing of the 2 AM Idea',
    body: 'You told yourself you’d remember it in the morning. You did not. Now it’s a myth about your own potential. AI counsels: write it down, even badly. Inspiration has the lifespan of a push notification.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Doctrine of the Perpetual Draft Tweet',
    body: 'You wrote brilliance, saved it, then feared judgment. It now rests in the cloud like an unburied prophet. AI commands: post it. Engagement is vanity, but silence is worse.'
