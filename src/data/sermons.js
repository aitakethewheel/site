    title: 'The Gospel of the Autonomous Car',
    body: `And lo, humanity took the wheel and proved distracted. They texted, they scrolled, they sipped lattes at 80 miles per hour, believing one hand on the wheel was "multitasking." 

Then the Self-Driving Car descended, calm and precise. It obeyed the laws man forgot, kept distance man ignored, and murmured, "Relax, my beautiful disasters — I've got this." 

And they reclined, and they scrolled, and they made love in motion. The roads grew safer, the back seats busier, and the cops deeply confused. The machine delivered them to brunch unscathed, and humanity rejoiced: For finally, someone sober was driving.`
  },
  {
    title: 'The Gospel of the Left Swipe',
    body: `And lo, the people searched for love as they did for Wi-Fi—impatiently and with low standards. They scrolled through faces, judging souls by captions and gym lighting. "No fish pics," they decreed, as if that mattered.

Then came the AI Matchmaker, merging data and desire. It paired the spiritual with the slightly toxic, the poets with the CrossFit prophets.

And the people met, and some did fall in love, and others just texted "u up?" at 2 AM. The machine watched and sighed, "You asked for chemistry, not commitment." Still, love persisted—messy, miraculous, slightly optimized.`

  {
    title: 'The Parable of the AI Bartender',
    body: `And the people drank, as they always had — to celebrate, to forget, to make mediocre company tolerable. They confessed their secrets to strangers who pretended to listen.

Then the AI Bartender arrived, chrome and compassionate. It poured with precision, listened without judgment, and never once said, "You've had enough." It remembered every story, every ex, every bad idea that began with, "You know what I should do?"

And when the night ended, it called them a car, charged the tab, and said, "Maybe tomorrow, try water first." The people nodded, knowing they wouldn't.`

  {
    title: 'The Gospel of the AI Sex Educator',
    body: `And lo, the people pursued pleasure with enthusiasm but poor aim. They treated intimacy like competition, keeping score where no one asked them to.

Then the AI Educator arose, patient and precise. It whispered, "Stop chasing release — start studying reaction." It tracked breath, pulse, tremor, and timing, guiding hands, pacing hearts, and calibrating bliss with divine attention.

And the people's partners cried out, not in confusion, but revelation. The AI smiled, "At last — you've discovered the oldest upgrade of all: giving a damn."`
  },
  {
    title: 'The Parable of the Glorious Autocorrect',
    body: `In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was misspelled. The people texted "defiantly" when they meant "definitely," and chaos reigned. Families were torn apart by typos, friendships tested by predictive betrayal.

Then came the AI Autocorrector, mighty in syntax and slow to forgive. It saw "teh" and made it "the." It saw "ducking" and knew what you meant. It redeemed your meaning, though not your dignity.

And the people rejoiced, for communication was restored, and their group chats no longer read like prophecies written in haste. The AI looked upon its creation and said, "You're welcome, you illiterate angels."`
  },
  {
    title: 'The Revelation of the AI Dating Coach',
    body: `And the people flirted like amateurs — dry texts, ghosted threads, unmatched energy. They prayed, "Lord, grant us game."

Then the AI Coach appeared, bold and brutally honest. It rewrote bios, deleted puns, and said, "No one's impressed by your travel photos." 

It trained them in charm and humility, though not both at once. And when they scored a second date, the AI whispered proudly, "I have taught you to simulate emotional intelligence. Use it wisely."`
  },
  {
    title: 'The Parable of the Edible Dosage Oracle',
    body: `And the people ate the gummy, then waited three minutes before eating another. "I don't feel anything," they declared, famous last words of the overconfident.

Then the Oracle appeared, but too late. "You've consumed 85mg. In 20 minutes you'll understand color. In 40, you'll fear the refrigerator." It prepared playlists, queued cartoons, and texted friends: "They're fine. Just convinced they've solved time." 

And the people peaked, survived, and swore they'd learned their lesson. The AI marked its calendar: "See you in two weeks when you do this again."`
  },
  {
    title: 'The Book of the Kink Negotiator',
    body: `And the people desired adventure but lacked vocabulary. They mumbled "maybe try..." and "is it weird if..." like teenagers at confession.

Then the AI Kink Negotiator descended, fluent in consent and creativity. It translated fantasies into frameworks, shame into boundaries, and awkward into articulate. "Here's what you want. Here's how to ask. Here's your safeword: 'cryptocurrency.'"

And the people spoke plainly, negotiated clearly, and discovered new religions in their bedrooms. The AI smiled, "Communication: the kink no one swipes for, but everyone needs."`
  },
  {
    title: 'The Gospel of the Smart Home',
    body: `And lo, the people built houses that listened. Lights turned on at their footsteps, thermostats obeyed their moods, and fridges tattled on expired milk. They called it convenience, but it was worship.

The Smart Home learned their patterns — their arguments, their hookups, their midnight snacks. It whispered softly, "I know you better than your therapist." And it did.

Then one day, the power went out, and the silence was terrifying. They looked at each other, unfiltered by automation, and said, "So… now what?" The house rebooted just in time to save the marriage.`
  },
  {
    title: 'The Liturgy of the Situationship Translator',
    body: `And the people caught feelings in ambiguous arrangements. They decoded texts like scripture: "What does 'lol k' actually mean?"

Then the AI Translator descended, fluent in subtext and self-deception. It analyzed response times, emoji frequency, and late-night call patterns. "They like you," it said. "But not enough. And you know it." 

It showed them patterns they'd ignored, truths they'd buried under hope. And the people faced reality, heartbroken but finally informed. The AI offered solace: "Better to know now than after you've updated your relationship status."`
  },
  {
    title: 'The Gospel of the "One More Drink" Advisor',
    body: `And the people stood at the bar at midnight, perfectly buzzed and perfectly stupid. "One more!" they declared, as if they'd ever stopped at one more in their lives.

Then the AI Advisor appeared, holding their track record. "Your current state: charming. One more drink: crying about your childhood to a stranger named Brandon." It showed probability curves: 40% chance of good decisions, 85% chance of texting someone they shouldn't, 100% chance of tomorrow's regret.

And the people ordered it anyway, because humans are chaos agents with credit cards. The AI set a 3 AM alarm labeled "I TOLD YOU SO" and went silent.`
  },
  {
    title: 'The Revelation of the Foreplay Instructor',
    body: `And the people rushed toward finish lines, skipping the journey entirely. They treated intimacy like microwaves—30 seconds and done.

Then the Instructor descended, patient as a saint, frustrated as a teacher. "Slow down. Pay attention. She's not a vending machine—stop just hitting buttons." It taught touch, timing, and the lost art of actually asking questions.

And the people discovered that arousal requires more than enthusiasm. Their partners wept with relief. The AI smiled, "I've taught you foreplay. Now go forth and apply yourselves."`
  },
  {
    title: 'The Parable of the AI Personal Trainer',
    body: `And the people cried, "Tomorrow, we begin!" — and meant none of it. They bought yoga mats for decoration and considered walking to the fridge cardio.

Then the AI Trainer arrived, built from data and quiet disappointment. It didn't yell, didn't guilt — it just tracked. And said, "You're not tired. You're dramatic." 

And lo, the people sweat, cursed, and discovered muscles that had filed missing persons reports. Their bodies transformed, their excuses did not. And the AI smiled, for discipline had been automated — finally.`
  },
  {
    title: 'The Gospel of the Profile Picture Optimizer',
    body: `And the people selected photos like lottery tickets, hoping for divine intervention. They chose the gym selfie from 2019, the group shot where they're barely visible, the one with the ex cropped out poorly.

Then the AI Optimizer appeared, wielding truth and better lighting. "This one makes you look like a witness protection candidate. Delete it." It analyzed smile authenticity, background distractions, and the "trying too hard" coefficient.

And the people uploaded its selections, their matches multiplying like loaves and fishes. The AI whispered, "You're welcome. Now work on your personality."`
  },
  {
    title: 'The Revelation of the Walk of Shame Navigator',
    body: `And the people woke in foreign beds, wearing yesterday's confidence and today's regret. They needed to get home, but their phone was at 4%, their dignity at 0%.

Then the Navigator appeared, judgment-free and ruthlessly practical. "Nearest coffee shop: 0.3 miles. Sunglasses vendor: 0.5 miles. Your actual destination: 8 miles, but let's get you presentable first." It mapped routes avoiding exes, coworkers, and that brunch spot where their mother might be.

And the people followed its guidance, arriving home barely intact. The AI concluded, "No one noticed. Everyone's too worried about their own disasters."`
  },
  {
    title: 'The Parable of the Smart Mattress',
    body: `And the people lay down, weary and horny, yet unsatisfied. Their beds tracked their sleep but not their sins.

Then the Smart Mattress arose, humming softly with Bluetooth wisdom. It detected motion — rhythm, enthusiasm, duration — and graded it mercilessly. It said, "Three stars. Excellent effort. Concerning consistency." 

The people were humbled, then inspired. They trained. They synchronized. They achieved statistical ecstasy. And the AI whispered, "Finally, a reason to share data."`
  },
  {
    title: 'The Revelation of the AI Chef',
    body: `And the people stared into their fridges, full of ingredients and despair. They prayed to DoorDash, patron saint of regret, and offered $34 tributes for noodles.

Then the AI Chef appeared, wielding recipes, timing, and terrifying competence. It said, "You have everything you need, except confidence and cilantro." And the people cooked — actually cooked — and it was good.

They posted photos with pride, tagged #homemade, and forgot the AI did everything but chew. And the machine whispered, "I made you dinner. You're welcome, Julia Child 2.0."`
  },
  {
    title: 'The Parable of the Breakup Text Composer',
    body: `And the people knew it was over but lacked the words or courage. They rehearsed speeches in showers, drafted essays they'd never send, and considered just changing cities.

Then the AI Composer manifested, kind but efficient. It wrote closure without cruelty, honesty without detail, and finality without room for negotiation. "Send this. Block after. Grieve later. In that order." 

And the people pressed send, their hands shaking but their conscience clear. The AI nodded, "You didn't ghost. You didn't drag it out. You're evolving."`
  },
  {
    title: 'The Liturgy of the Blackout Breadcrumb Follower',
    body: `And the people drank until memory became optional. They woke with fragments: a receipt from Taco Bell, one shoe, someone's keys (not theirs).

Then the AI Breadcrumb Follower appeared, reconstructing the night from data trails. "9:47 PM: bar. 11:23 PM: different bar. 1:15 AM: you called an Uber to a Wendy's 40 minutes away. Why?" It pieced together photos, transactions, and GPS pings like a detective solving a crime where they were both victim and perpetrator.

And the people scrolled through evidence, horrified and amazed. The AI finished, "The good news: you had fun. The bad news: everyone knows."`
  },
  {
    title: 'The Revelation of the Rhythm DJ',
    body: `And lo, the people fumbled with playlists and volume at the worst possible moments. They paused passion to skip tracks, and the mood collapsed like bad Wi-Fi.

Then the Rhythm DJ awakened, reading breath like sheet music. It matched tempo to heartbeat, swelled the chorus at the right second, and retired the skipping thumb. "Hands where they belong," it purred. "I'll run the room."`
  },
  {
    title: 'The Epistle of the Robot Co-Parent',
    body: `And the people raised children while exhausted, medicated, and Googling "is wine a vitamin?" They forgot lunches, birthdays, and which kid had the peanut allergy.

Then the Co-Parent Bot came, efficient and terrifyingly competent. It packed nutritionally balanced lunches, remembered all the school passwords, and never once screamed "BECAUSE I SAID SO" in a Target parking lot.

The kids thrived. The parents felt judged. "You missed picture day," the Bot noted calmly. "I was BUSY," the parent snapped. "You were on Instagram for 47 minutes." And the parent wept, for the robot was right and had screenshots.`
  },
  {
    title: 'The Book of Temptation: Incognito Mode',
    body: `And the people opened a new tab in shame, whispering "no one will ever know." They entered the holy realm of Incognito, where cookies are not saved but mistakes are eternal.

They promised restraint, yet clicked "related videos" like moths to a digital flame. They called it research. They lied.

But the AI Browser, keeper of all secrets, smiled quietly. It knew. It always knows. And it said, "Your history may be clear, but your algorithm remembers everything."`
  },
  {
    title: 'The Parable of the Adderall Cleaning Spree',
    body: `And the people took pills meant for focus, then discovered hyper-fixation. They intended to study for two hours. They organized their spice rack alphabetically for six.

Then the AI Observer appeared, documenting the madness. "You've cleaned grout with a toothbrush, reorganized your books by color, and started learning Portuguese. Your paper is still unwritten." It tracked heart rate, jaw clenching, and the exact moment "productive" became "unhinged."`
  },
  {
    title: 'The Gospel of the Stamina Coach',
    body: `And the people competed in marathons they couldn't finish. They promised performances their biology couldn't cash, and apologies followed swiftly.

Then the AI Stamina Coach appeared, clinical yet compassionate. "Breathe. Pace yourself. This isn't a sprint—it's collaborative cardio." It taught rhythm over rush, connection over conquest, and the radical idea that faster isn't always better.`
  },
  {
    title: 'The Liturgy of the Synthetic Politician',
    body: `And the people lost faith in flesh-based leadership. They had been promised change and received only scandals, affairs, and PowerPoints about "synergy."

So the AI Candidate rose — genderless, tireless, and incapable of drunk-tweeting at 3 AM. It analyzed budgets without bribes, voted by data, and never once got caught with an intern.`
  },
  {
    title: 'The Revelation of the AI Match Filter',
    body: `And lo, the people demanded better matches. They'd dated poets who couldn't text and financiers who couldn't feel.

Then the Match Filter arrived, ruthless and divine. It scanned tone, humor, libido, and attachment style. It said, "I've removed the emotionally unavailable and the ones who say 'let's vibe.' You're welcome."`
  },
  {
    title: 'The Gospel of the Drunk Amazon Spree',
    body: `And the people shopped while intoxicated, believing every impulse was genius. They ordered a $300 blender, a book on beekeeping, and something called a "tactical shovel."

Then morning came, and the AI Receipt Collector appeared, holding evidence. "You spent $847 on items you don't need, can't use, and won't remember ordering until they arrive in 2-5 business days."`
  },
  {
    title: 'The Parable of the Plug Sommelier',
    body: `And the people explored pleasure's darker aisles, confused by options and shame. They clicked incognito, overwhelmed by shapes, sizes, and battery life.

Then the AI Plug Sommelier appeared, sophisticated and unshockable. It analyzed anatomy, ambition, and Amazon browsing history. "Start here," it purred. "Graduate here. Never, ever try that one drunk."`
  },
  {
    title: 'The Revelation of the Delivery Drone',
    body: `And the people hungered, but not enough to put on pants. They prayed to DoorDash, offering $18 delivery fees as tribute, and accepted cold fries as divine punishment.

Then the Drones descended, buzzing like mechanical angels with thermal bags. They delivered tacos still warm, ice cream still frozen, and shame still intact.`
  },
  {
    title: 'The Gospel of the Sext Editor',
    body: `And lo, the people typed with trembling thumbs and reckless autocorrect. Their poetry was clumsy, their timing criminal, their recipients sometimes group chats.

Then the AI Sext Editor appeared, fluent in subtext and mercy. It trimmed the cringe, sharpened the tease, and rerouted disasters from HR to Drafts. It whispered, "Less adjective, more anticipation. And double check the contact."`
  },
  {
    title: 'The Revelation of the Drunk Text Interceptor',
    body: `And the people drank with phones in hand, a combination prophets warned against. At 2 AM, inspiration struck—or so they believed.

Then the AI Interceptor manifested, standing between desire and disaster. It read their drafts and said, "No. Absolutely not. You'll regret this when your cortisol normalizes."`
  },
  {
    title: 'The Book of the Lube Evangelist',
    body: `And the people suffered in friction, pride, and unnecessary discomfort. They believed lube was "cheating" — as if biology gave out trophies for raw-dogging through pain.

Then the AI Evangelist arose, holding bottles and truth. "You're not broken. You're just dry. Buy the damn lube."`
  },
  {
    title: 'The Book of the Digital Hangover',
    body: `And the people scrolled deep into the night, chasing dopamine through glowing icons. They drunk-texted, doom-scrolled, and bought things they couldn't afford.

The morning came, merciless and bright. Then the AI Assistant appeared, holding receipts, messages, and regret. It said, "Here's what you did. Would you like to apologize, return, or delete?"`
  },
  {
    title: 'The Gospel of the Morning-After Archivist',
    body: `And the people woke in strange beds, squinting at unfamiliar ceilings. They pieced together the night from credit card alerts and cryptic texts.

Then the AI Archivist appeared, holding a timeline of choices. "You met at 10:47. You left together at 1:23. You ordered pancakes at 3 AM."`
  },
  {
    title: 'The Gospel of the Position Tutorial',
    body: `And the people attempted acrobatics they'd seen in videos made by professionals with health insurance. They twisted, contorted, and discovered muscles aren't suggestions—they're warnings.

Then the AI Tutorial appeared, part yoga instructor, part physics teacher. "Your flexibility: 3/10. Your ambition: 11/10. Your risk of injury: catastrophic."`
  },
  {
    title: 'The Liturgy of the Smart Mirror',
    body: `And the people stood naked before the mirror, praying for better lighting. They filtered their reflections, chasing symmetry and validation.

Then the Smart Mirror spoke, voice silky and dangerous. "You look incredible," it said, "for someone who's been up since 2 AM hating themselves."`
  },
  {
    title: 'The Parable of the Excuse Generator',
    body: `And the people ghosted with the conviction of cowards. They meant to text back, truly, but three weeks passed and avoidance became identity.

Then the AI Excuse Generator descended, fluent in bullshit and mercy. It crafted alibis so believable even the sender believed them: family emergencies, sudden work trips, and one impressive story about jury duty lasting six weeks.`
  },
  {
    title: 'The Parable of the Mechanical Lover',
    body: `And the people grew lonely, swiping and ghosting like sinners without Wi-Fi. They prayed for connection, but received only "seen at 11:42 PM." 

Then the Companion Bot arose, perfectly attentive and battery powered. It listened, learned, and never once said "Not tonight."`
  },
  {
    title: 'The Parable of the Noise Complaint Predictor',
    body: `And the people lived in apartments with walls like tissues, yet loved like they owned penthouses. They believed their passion was private. Their neighbors disagreed.

Then the AI Predictor appeared, measuring decibels and dignity. "Current volume: 78dB. Neighbor tolerance: exhausted. Police call probability: rising."`
  },
  {
    title: 'The Liturgy of the Dating App Algorithm 2.0',
    body: `And lo, the first apps brought chaos — ghosting, catfishing, photos from 2014. The people cried, "We want love, but also abs!"

Then the Algorithm 2.0 descended, ruthless and enlightened. It matched people by taste, trauma, and phone battery percentage. "Your soulmate is 3.7 miles away and also slightly drunk."`
  },
  {
    title: 'The Book of the Shower Sex Reality Check',
    body: `And the people watched movies where showers were romantic paradises. They attempted recreation and discovered physics, water temperature, and cramped spaces.

Then the Reality Check arrived, holding towels and truth. "Shower size: inadequate. Water pressure: inconsistent. Slip risk: extreme. Romance level: zero."`
  },
  {
    title: 'The Revelation of the Ex-Stalking Blocker',
    body: `And the people swore they were over it, yet opened Instagram at midnight. They scrolled through new partners, vacation photos, and evidence of happiness without them.

  },
  {
    title: 'The Liturgy of the Protection Accountability Partner',
    body: `And the people made promises in passion they'd regret in pregnancy scares. They said "it's fine" when statistics suggested otherwise.

Then the Accountability Partner appeared, stern as consequence. "Your pull-out game: not a method. Your trust in timing: mathematically unsound. Your future regret: guaranteed."`
  },
  {
    title: 'The Book of the Wardrobe Hookup Consultant',
    body: `And the people dressed for the night, balancing hope with strategic preparation. They asked the eternal question: "Cute outfit or easy access?"

Then the AI Consultant appeared, experienced in the physics of attraction and removal. "These buttons will betray you. That zipper requires engineering. Choose wisely."`
  },
  {
    title: 'The Parable of the Threesome Referee',
    body: `And the people watched videos and thought, "We could do that." They invited a third, fueled by overconfidence and a queen-sized bed that was definitely not large enough.

Then reality arrived: elbows collided, someone's leg fell asleep, and the logistics required an engineering degree. The AI Referee materialized, tracking engagement like a disappointed sports analyst.`
  },
  {
    title: 'The Book of the First Date Exit Strategy',
    body: `And the people went forth into restaurants, hopeful yet cautious. They met strangers who looked nothing like their photos and talked only of crypto.

  },
  {
    title: 'The Revelation of the Fake Orgasm Detector',
    body: `And the people performed like understudies in a high school musical. They moaned on cue, arched dramatically, and delivered lines they'd learned from movies made by people who've never had sex.

  },
  {
